# Disambiguating Statistical Jargon from Multiple Fields

Statistics and mathematics are so powerful that methods keep getting rediscovered by all sorts of scientists. That's awesome!
But what's not awesome is that every time somebody rediscovers an idea, it gets a new name, and now one branch of science
can't talk to another branch of science.

This repository seeks to make it just a little bit easier for people from different fields to talk to each other. Here you'll
find a list of methods that exist in various fields, along with examples of how to use them and code that you can copy and
paste. You can use this repository in multiple ways:

* Reading a paper outside your field? Ctrl-F for the method names you don't understand and see if there's a synonym!
* Writing a paper for a broader audience? Provide code in multiple languages!
* Discovering how other fields work? Just read some papers using the same ideas in different areas!
